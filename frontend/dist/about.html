to upload their location data and members of the community to compare their own location to verify whether
they have potentially been exposed to the virus. The user who has been positively tested with COVID-19 uploads
their data, inputting the range in which they were sick and had symptoms. The web application would then display
this location data on a map; in order to protect the privacy of the user, the application allows them to erase
areas they want to hide, such as their home address. Once the user is satisfied with their privacy, they enter
the upload button. Their data then gets put into a SQLite3 database. Anonymous users can then acquire their own
location history from google and load it into the website. The application will then check if they were in a
nearby radius of someone who has COVID-19. After their location history is compared, any intersection between
the interested member and a user infected with the virus will be shown with a marker dot, indicating how far
the affected member was in the infection cycle. In order to maintain user privacy, individual metrics will not
be shown. If the interested member learns that they have been exposed to the virus, they have an option to
upload their data as well and can view other pages of the website which inform what next steps to take, whether
it be self-isolation or testing.</p><br><h5>Built By</h5><p>Built by Govind Pimpale with help from Ganesh Pimpale and Nitya Girase </p><h2>FAQs</h2><h5>Q: What is the purpose of this website?</h5><p style="margin-bottom: 50px">A: The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases has all experts worried and has
brought the world to a standstill. If the virus continues to spread at the current rate, it is projected that it
can potentially result in 100 million cases just in the U.S. The best case scenario for the vaccine&rsquo;s
availability is early 2021 and currently no proven medicine to treat it exists; even when this treatment is
found, infected patients will be treated, but it would not stop the spread until the vaccine is available. Until
this time, social distancing serves as the only method of limiting the spread of the highly contagious virus.
Therefore, it is not only critical to isolate those who are affected but also those who have potentially come in
contact with the affected people. Currently, for the general public there is no source for the whereabouts to
easily find if they have come in contact with an affected person.</p><h5>Q: Are there any security concerns that come with letting you test your system? Can people enter false data?</h5><p style="margin-bottom: 50px">A: The data we store is anonymized and does not make a reference to user names. In addition, it is STRONGLY reccomended
that users erase any and all personal information such as place of residence before uploading data. As for entering false
data, it is theoretically possible to do so, but obviously false data will be flagged and possibly erased.</p><h5>Q: If a user finds out they have come in contact with someone positively tested with COVID-19 what should they
do?</h5><p style="margin-bottom:50px">A: It's important to note that this tool is not omniscient, and it cannot possibly locate all possible exposures of
coronavirus, nor confim that a given point on the map is actually infected. However, it would be prudent to try to
generally reduce contact if you're not sure you have the virus in order to prevent spreading it to others. If severely ill,
you should contact a doctor in addition.</p><h5>Q: Where do I find my location history?</h5><p style="margin-bottom:50px">A: There are several ways in which you can access your location history. One way is
to download your location history from Google. Since all your Google data is toggled on by default, first select
&quot;Select None&quot; on the page, and then scroll down the page to select Location History from the list. You can also
access your location history if you use Google Map. Launch Google Maps, tap the more button (the button with
three lines) in the left corner, and lastly tap the timeline to view your location history. Additionally, if you
have a Snapchat, you can access your location history ranging from the current day to 40
days before.</p></div></section></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container-fluid py-1"><br><p><a class="text-light" href="about.html">About and FAQs</a></p><p><a class="text-light" href="termsofservice.html">Terms of Service</a></p><p class="text-light">&copy; Govind Pimpale</p></div></footer></body></html>
